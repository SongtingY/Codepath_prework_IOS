### App idea that you would like to build

Name of the App: Local Coffee Shop Explorer
Description: 
My app idea is to create a platform that helps coffee enthusiasts discover and explore local coffee shops. Users can add coffee shops, rate them based on community feedback, and access detailed information like special drinks, recommendations for first-time visitors, and whether the shop roasts its own beans. The app aims to foster a community of coffee lovers by providing regular updates on shop specials and encouraging user engagement through shared experiences and photos.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
While building this app, I encountered a challenge when trying to implement a feature to change a button's color. Initially, I was uncertain about which element to include for this functionality. After carefully reviewing the code, I realized that I needed to use the name I had assigned in connecting the ViewController. However, the first few attempts to change the color were unsuccessful. The button's color didn't change as expected. I later discovered that this issue was due to the background color being set at the beginning of the process. This initial setting was overriding the new changes I was trying to implement. Once I identified this problem, I was able to adjust the code accordingly, ensuring that the new color change function worked correctly without being affected by the previous background color setting.
